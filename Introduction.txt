Introduction:

What is Python?
Python is a high level, interpreted, dynamically typed programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and wide applicability across software, data, 
and automation domains.

History:
--------
Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch software engineer working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. 
Development began in December 1989 as a successor to the ABC language, with the goal of creating a language that emphasized simplicity, readability, and extensibility

Python was first publicly released in February 1991 (version 0.9.1). Even in its earliest form, Python included high‑level data structures such as 
  lists and dictionaries, 
  exception handling, 
  functions and 
  a modular architecture, 
reflecting its focus on developer productivity from the beginning

The name “Python” was inspired by the BBC television show Monty Python’s Flying Circus, not the snake, highlighting the creator’s intention to keep the language enjoyable and approachable
