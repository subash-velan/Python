Python Sets:
  In Python, Sets are built-in data structure that stores unordered collection of data

  1. Duplicates : Do not contain any duplicates, duplicates are automatically removed
  2. Un-Ordered : Un-ordered collection of data
  3. Mutable : Items can be add/remove
  4. Index-Based : Not index based
  5. DataType : Set elements must be hashable    
      Valid: int, float, string, tuple
      Invalid: list, dict, set

Creating Set:
  Using {}:
    s = {1,2,3,4,5}

  Using set():
    s = set([1,2,3,4,5])

  set() class:
    s = {} # its a dictionary
    s = set() # it is right way to create

  Adding Elements:
      add() : adds a single item
      update() : adds multiple elements

      Example:
      s.add(50)
      s.update([60, 70, 80])

  Removing Elements:
      remove() : Removes specified elements from the set, it raise KeyError if not exist
      discard() : It is used to safer removing of an element, even element not available in the set
      pop() : Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set, throws error if set is empty
      clear() : removes all elements from the set

      s.remove(20)
      s.discard(20)
      s.pop()
      s.clear()

Minimum and Maximum of Sets - min() and max():

  s1 = {4, 12, 10, 9, 4, 13}
  print(min(s1))      
  print(max(s1))

Set Operations:
  Python sets provides all standard mathematical operations such as UNION, INTERSECTION, DIFFERENCE and SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE
  UNION : The union of two sets combines all unique elements from both sets.
    c = a | b
    c = a.union(b)
  
  INTERSECTION: The intersection of two sets includes only the common elements present in both sets
    c = a & b
    c = a.intersection(b)

  DIFFERENCE: The difference between two sets includes elements present in the first set but not in the second.
    set3 = set1 - set2  # Using the '-' operator
    set3 = set1.difference(set2)  # Using the difference() method

    Example:
      A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
      B = {3, 4, 5, 6}
      
      # Using '-' operator
      res1 = A - B
      print("using '-':", res1)
      
      # Using difference() method
      res2 = A.difference(B)
      print("using difference():", res2)

  SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE:
    
    set3 = set1 ^ set2  # Using the '^' operator
    set3 = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)  # Using the symmetric_difference() method
  
    Example:
      A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
      B = {3, 4, 5, 6}
      
      # Using '^' operator
      res1 = A ^ B
      print("using '^':", res1)
      
      # Using symmetric_difference() method
      res2 = A.symmetric_difference(B)
      print("using symmetric_difference():", res2)

Frozen Sets:
  It is built-in data type that is similar to sets but it is immutable
  Once frozenset is created, we cannot add or remove
  A frozenset cannot contain duplicate elements

  # Creating a frozenset from a list
  fset = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  print(fset)
