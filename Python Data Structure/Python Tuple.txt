Python Tuple:
  In Python, Tuple is built-in data structure it can hold ordered collection of elements. It behaves like read-only lists

    1. Duplicates : Allow duplicate items to store
    2. Ordered : Elements keep their order
    3. Immutable : Items can't be modified once created
    4. DataType : Allow mixed data type
    5. Index-Based : Items are accessed using thied positions

Creating Tuple:
  A tuple is created by placing all the items inside parentheses (), separated by commas. A tuple can have any number of items and they can be of different data types.
  tup = ()
  print(tup)
  
  # Using String
  tup = ('Hello', 'World')
  print(tup)
  
  # Using List
  li = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
  print(tuple(li))
  
  # Using Built-in Function
  tup = tuple('Hello')
  print(tup)

  # Using commas
  tup = 'Hello','World'
  print(tup)

Tuple Operations:
  Accessing elements:
  Example:
    t = ("a", "b", "c")
    print(t[0])

  Slicing:
  Example:
    t = (10, 20, 30, 40)
    print(t[1:3])

Deleting a Tuple:
  Since tuples are immutable, we cannot delete individual elements of a tuple. However, we can delete an entire tuple using del statement. 
  Printing of Tuple after deletion results in an Error.

  Example:
  tup = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
  del tup
  
  print(tup)

Tuple Unpacking with Asterisk (*):

  In Python, the " * " operator can be used in tuple unpacking to grab multiple items into a list. This is useful when you want to extract just a few specific elements and collect the rest together.

  Example:
  tup = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

  a, *b, c = tup
  
  print(a) 
  print(b) 
  print(c)

  a gets the first item.
  c gets the last item.
  *b collects everything in between into a list.
