Python Variables:

  In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. A variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a values

  1. Unlike other progrmming language, Python variables do not required explicit data type declaration
  2. The type of variable is inferred based on the value assignment

Example:
a = 10
b = "Python"
print(a)
print(b)

Output:
10 #number
Python #string

Rules for Naming Variables:

To use variables effectively, we must follow Python’s naming rules:

Variable names can only contain letters, digits and underscores (_).
A variable name cannot start with a digit.
Variable names are case-sensitive like myVar and myvar are different.
Avoid using Python keywords like if, else, for as variable names.

Below listed variable names are valid:
age = 21
_colour = "lilac"
total_score = 90

Below listed variables names are invalid:
1name = "Error"  # Starts with a digit
class = 10       # 'class' is a reserved keyword
user-name = "Doe"  # Contains a hyphen
