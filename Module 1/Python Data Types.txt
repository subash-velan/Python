Python Data Types:

  Data Types are a way to classify the data items. They represents the kind of value, which determines what operation could perform on that data
since everything is object in python programming, Python datatypes are classes and its variables (Object) are instances of these classes

Build-in Data Types:
  1. Numeric Types  -- int, float, complex
  2. Sequence Types -- string, lists, tuples, range
  3. Mapping Types -- dict
  4. Set Types -- set, frozenset
  5. Binary Types -- bytes, bytearray, memoryview
  6. None types -- none
  7. Boolen -- bool [True, False]
