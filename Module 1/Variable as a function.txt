Assign Function to a Variable in Python:

In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments and returned from other functions. Assigning a function to a variable enables function calls using the variable name, enhancing reusability.

# defining a function
def a(): 
  print("GFG")
  
# assigning function to a variable
var=a
​
# calling the variable
var()

Output
GFG
Explanation: a() prints "GFG". It is assigned to var, which now holds a reference to a(). Calling var() executes a().

To assign a function to a variable, use the function name without parentheses (). If parentheses are used, the function executes immediately and assigns its return value to the variable instead of the function itself.

Syntax:
# Defining a function

def fun():

    # Function body

    pass

# Assigning function to a variable

var = fun

# Calling the function using the variable

var()
