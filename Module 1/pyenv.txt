What is pyenv?
  pyenv is a Python version manager — a tool that lets you install, manage, and switch between multiple Python versions on the same machine without touching your system Python.
You can think of pyenv as the controller for your Python interpreters.

Usage:
1. Install multiple versions:
  > pyenv install 3.10.12
  > pyenv install 3.11.7

2. Switch versions globally:
  > pyenv global 3.13.5
3. Set Python version per project:
  > pyenv local 3.11.7
4. Temporarily use a version for one shell:
  > pyenv shell 3.9.18

pyenv => chooses Python version
venv => isolates packages for that project
