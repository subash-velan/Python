Loops:
  Loops in Python are used to repeat actions efficiently. There are two types in Python
  1. For Loop
  2. While Loop

1. For Loop:
  For loops is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string or range. It allow to execute a block of code repeatedly, once for each item in the sequence.
  Example:
  n = 5
  for i in range(0,n):
      print(i)

  li = ["red", "green", "blue"]
  for x in li:
      print(x)
      
  tup = ("red", "green", "blue")
  for x in tup:
      print(x)
      
  s = "abc"
  for x in s:
      print(x)
      
  d = dict({'x':123, 'y':354})
  for x in d:
      print("%s  %d" % (x, d[x]))
      
  set1 = {10, 30, 20}
  for x in set1:
      print(x)

While Loop:
  In Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

In below code, loop runs as long as the condition cnt < 3 is true. It increments the counter by 1 on each iteration and prints "Hello World" three times.

Example:
  cnt = 0
  while (cnt < 3):
      cnt = cnt + 1
      print("Hello World")

Loop Constrol Statements:
    Loop control statements in Python are special keywords that change the normal flow of a loop.
    They let you stop, skip, or add extra behavior to loops.
    1. break
    2. continue
    3. else with loop
    4. pass

  1. break:
     Stops the loop immediately, even if the loop condition is still True.
     Example:
      for i in range(10):
          if i == 5:
            break
          print(i)
      The loop exit after execution of 4, while reaching i at 5 would break the loop of execution

  2. continue:
     Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
     Example:
      for i in range(10):
          if i == 5:
              continue
          print(i)

    This prints 0–9 except 5.

 3. else with loop:
    The else block runs only when the loop finishes normally (no break occurred).
    Example:
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    else:
        print("Loop finished without break")
    
    With break in loop:

      for i in range(5):
          if i == 3:
              break
          print(i)
      else:
          print("This will NOT run")

    The else part does not run because break was used.

  4. pass:

     We use pass statement in Python to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statements, functions and classes.

     Example:
     for letter in 'geeksforgeeks':
        pass
     print('Last Letter :', letter)
