Execution of Python Programs:

  Python is often described as an interpreted language, but internally it uses both a compiler and an interpreter. Understanding this dual mechanism is critical to understanding Python’s performance, portability, and behavior

Overview: How Python Executes Code:
----------------------------------
Python execution happens in two major phases:

  1. Compilation Phase - Source code is converted into byte code
  2. Interpretation Phase - Byte Code is executed by Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

  High‑Level Flow:

    Source Code (.py)
        ↓
    Python Compiler
        ↓
    Bytecode (.pyc)
        ↓
    Python Virtual Machine (Interpreter)
        ↓
    Output

1. Python Compiler (Compilation Phase)
  The python compiler is an internal components of Python runtime that;

    i. Reads .py source code
    ii. Checks the syntax
    iii. Converts the source code into byte code
  This compilation is automatic and invisible to user

  1.1. What is Bytecode?
    i. Byte code is a low-level, platform independant instruction set
    ii. It is not a machine level language
    iii. Designed specially for Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
    
    Example Bytecode:
      LOAD_CONST
      STORE_NAME
      BINARY_ADD
      CALL_FUNCTION
  
  1.2. .pyc files and __pycache__ folder
    i. Compiled bytecode is stored as .pyc file
    ii. Located inside __pycache__ folder
    iii. Bytecode is reusable if source file has not changed
  Benefits: Faster startup and subsequence executions

  Python delays most decisions to runtime, not compile time

2. Python Interpreter (Execution Phase):
