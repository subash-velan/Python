pip:

pip stands for Pip install Packages
pip is the standard tool to install and manage Python libraries.
It makes sure your project gets the exact packages and versions it needs to run properly.

pip downloads packages from:

1. PyPI (Python Package Index — the main public repository)
2. Private/internal package registries
3. Local wheels or source directories

constrainst.txt:

A constraints.txt file assigns version limits to dependencies without specifying what should be installed.
It’s mainly used for enforcing organization-wide dependency versions, resolving conflicts, and applying security fixes across multiple projects.
Developers install normally using pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt, and pip ensures all direct and transitive dependencies stay within those constraints.
This provides reproducibility, consistency across microservices, and centralized governance.

requirements.txt:

requirements.txt is a file that lists all the dependencies required by a Python project, usually with specific version pins.
pip uses it to perform reproducible installations using pip install -r requirements.txt
It ensure dependencies are pinned, lockfiles are generated with pip-tools, environment-specific requirements are separated, and constraints files are used for organization-wide governance and security
