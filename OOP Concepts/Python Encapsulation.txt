Python Encapsulation:
    Encapsulation that involves to bundling data (attributes) and methods together within a single unit called class. By defining methods to controlling the access of these data and methods

Access Specifiers / Access Modifiers:
    There are three ways to protect data such as;
    1. Public
    2. Protected
    3. Private
    4. And additional special type in Python is @property

1. Public Members:
    Public members are variables or methods that can be accessed from anywhere inside the class, outside the class or another module. By default, all members in Python are public
    Its normal and no need a special symbol for define

    Example:
        class Employee:
            def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name   #Public members

            def print_name(self):  #Public Methods
                print(self.name)

        emp = Employee("Subash")
        emp.print_name()  #Accessible
        print(emp.name)   #Accessible

2. Protected Members:
    Protected members are variables or methods that are intended to be accessible within the class and its child class. They are not strictly private but treated as internal.

    Example:
    class Employee:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name  #Public
            self._age = age    #Protected

    class Display(Employee):
        def display_age(self):  
            print(self._age)    #Accessible in sub-class

    emp = Employee("Subash",30)    
    print(emp.name)             #Public accessible
    emp.display_age()           #Protected accessible via sub-class

3. Private Members:
    Private members are variables or methods that can't directly accessible from outside of the class. They are used to restrict access and protect internal data.
    In Python, private members are defined with double underscores as prefix (e.g. self.__salary).
    Python applies name mangling by intenally renaming (_ClassName__salary) them to prevent direct access

    Example:
    class Employee:
        def __init__(self, name, salary):
            self.name = name        #Public variables
            self.__salary = salary  #Private variables

    class Display(Employee):
        def display_salary(self):
            print(self.__salary)    

    emp = Employee("Subash",60000)
    print(emp.name)                #Public accessible
    emp.Diplay()                   #Private members accessing correct way
    print(emp.__salary)            #throws an error, private members can't access directly

Declaring Protected and Private Methods:

    In Python, you can control method access levels using naming conventions:
    
    Use a single underscore (_) before a method name to indicate it is protected meant to be used within class or its subclasses.
    Use a double underscore (__) to define a private method accessible only within class due to name mangling.
