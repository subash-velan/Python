Classes and Objects:
  What is class?
      A class is a blueprint or template for creation of object. It defines the attributes and methods
  
  What is object?
      An Object is a specific instances of a class. 
  
  
  Creating Class:
      A class is created by using a class keyword
      
      class Car:
        def __init__(self):
          pass
  
      obj1 = Car() #creating object for a class
      obj2 = Car() #create multiple object for the same class

Constructor:
__init__():

    The __init__ method acts as a constructor in Python and is automatically executed when the object is created
    It is used to create and initialize the attributes of an object with the values provided at the time of object creation

Types of Variables:
    There are two types of variables inside a class
    1. Class Variables
    2. Instance Variables

  1. Class Variable:
    These are variables defined at class level outsider of any methods, which is shared accross all instances of a class
    All objects of class share the same value of a class variable unless explicitly override an object

  2. Instance Variable:
    Variables that are unique to each instance (object) of a class. 
    These are defined within __init__() method or other instance methods. Each object maintains its own copy of instance variables, independent of other objects

    class Dog:
      # Class variable
      species = "Canine"
  
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          # Instance variables
          self.name = name
          self.age = age
  
    # Create objects
    dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
    dog2 = Dog("Charlie", 5)
    
    # Access class and instance variables
    print(dog1.species)  # (Class variable)
    print(dog1.name)     # (Instance variable)
    print(dog2.name)     # (Instance variable)
    
    # Modify instance variables
    dog1.name = "Max"
    print(dog1.name)     # (Updated instance variable)
    
    # Modify class variable
    Dog.species = "Feline"
    print(dog1.species)  # (Updated class variable)
    print(dog2.species)
